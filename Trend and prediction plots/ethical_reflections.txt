ðŸ§­ 3. Ethical Reflection: Bias & Fairness

Data Bias:

Geographical gaps: Some countries may be underrepresented, skewing results.

Temporal bias: Older data might be less reliable.

Model Fairness:

If a model is trained using data from certain countries, its performance may degrade for others with different socio-economic dynamics.

Predictions may perpetuate inequality if interventions donâ€™t account for diverse regional realities.

Privacy & Power Dynamics:

Ensure data privacy by using only publicly available aggregated stats.

Be transparent about model limitations when informing policymakers.

Recommendations:

Regularly audit model performance across countries/subgroups.

Include local stakeholders in interpreting predictions.

Design for fairness by incorporating data from all regions, not just high-data ones.
